docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c '\l'

- In some cases, psql in the docker container has been conflicted with psql installed on local machine, therefore
default port 5432 of psql is conflicted from both side(Docker and Local Machine). In my case, I had to change
the port 5432 from my docker-compose.yml file to 15432 to avoid conflicts. (15432: 5432). Please note that,
Docker works like a virtual machine, so it has own software installed inside of it.

ChatGPT version of my guidance:
- When running PostgreSQL in Docker, it may conflict with a PostgreSQL service already installed on your host 
machine, as both typically use the default port 5432. To avoid this, I updated the docker-compose.yml configuration 
to map Docker's internal port 5432 to an alternate host port (e.g., 15432:5432). This way, I can connect to the 
Dockerized database on port 15432 from my host without interfering with the local PostgreSQL service. Keep in mind 
that Docker containers are isolated environments — like mini virtual machines — and come with their own software, 
including psql, fully contained within the container.
